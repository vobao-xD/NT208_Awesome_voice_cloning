vi‚ìçTTS is a voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 6-second audio clip. This model is fine-tuned from the [XTTS-v2.0.3](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2) model by expanding the tokenizer to Vietnamese and fine-tuning on the [viVoice](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thinhlpg/viVoice) dataset.

### Languages

viXTTS supports 18 languages: English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt),
Polish (pl), Turkish (tr), Russian (ru), Dutch (nl), Czech (cs), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh-cn), Japanese (ja), Hungarian (hu), Korean (ko)
Hindi (hi), **Vietnamese (vi)**.

### Known Limitations

- Incompatibility with the [original TTS library](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) (a pull request will be made later).
- Subpar performance for input sentences under 10 words in Vietnamese language (yielding inconsistent output and odd trailing sounds).
- This model is only fine-tuned in Vietnamese. The model's effectiveness with languages other than Vietnamese hasn't been tested, potentially reducing quality.
